# Hello, World!

My name is Nick and I'm a first-year Computer Science major at RIT. Additionally, I'm a member of Computer Science House!

That's kind of an old picture (I have a beard and much longer hair now), but it's of me wearing an Iron Maiden shirt while playing the Iron Maiden pinball machine. It's funny and I *love* Iron Maiden, so why not?

This site is currently under construction, but for now you can check out some cool pictures I've taken on the [Photography](./photography.html) page.
