# Hello, World!

My name is Nick and I'm a first-year Computer Science major at RIT. Additionally, I'm a member of Computer Science House!

That's kind of an old picture (I have a beard and much longer hair now), but it's of me wearing an Iron Maiden shirt while playing the Iron Maiden pinball machine. It's funny and I *love* Iron Maiden, so why not?

## A not-so-brief introduction

I was born and raised in the Lakes Region of New Hampshire, aka the best place in the world (technically I was born in Plymouth in the White Mountains, but my family lived in Alexandria at the time). I love everything New Hampshire and New England, except for Hampton Beach which is a dirty, gross beach that you should not go to. Go somewhere in the Lakes Region instead!

In high school, I did band, drama, and robotics. I'm still trying to get into those at RIT, but mark my words, I will. My robotics team went to the FIRST Robotics Competition New England District Championship twice. I was also primarily responsible for creating the team's current branding, which I'm quite proud of.

I don't consider myself fluent, but I speak a little Spanish. Me gustaría viajar a muchos países, pero quiero ir a algún país como México o Argentina para practicar español. Tengo una amiga online de Argentina. Conocimos jugando Minecraft hasta 2019.

## Where do we go now?

You can learn more about me, my friends, and everything I'm interested in on the other pages on this site. I kind of use this site as a replacement for my CSH Wiki page since I think it's easier to organize, so just look around! (Professional website coming Soon^TM^)
