# My Peeps @ CSH

I try my best to be a friendly person, and my grand reward for that has been having a lot of friends through the years. Here are the cool people I've met at CSH. I'm blatantly stealing this idea from Julian (and, by extension, Ziti), so kudos to them for being more creative than me.

*TODO: Add pictures, especially that bomb-ass one of me and Andie.*

## Fershmen

If I didn't list you here, it might be because you don't have an account yet. Just let me know if you think you're missing.

### Andie (@bugsnax)

If there's anything that can distract me from doing actual schoolwork, it's playing vidya gaems. Andie is the only other CSHer I know who plays Splatoon, so I would be doing her a disservice by not putting her here. She also has great taste in music and is super friendly.

### Ethan (@nil)

To my knowledge, Ethan is the only other current CSHer from the Granite State, so that alone gets him an easy spot on this list. He's also just a cool guy to be around in general; he's always good company while studying in the User Center. He's also pretty funny and the way he says "what the fuck?" will never fail to make me smile.

### Jordan (@floridawoahman)

Jordan hardly ever sleeps, and the less she sleeps, the funnier she gets, so is that really a bad thing? (yes) She kind of dresses like a 12 year old boy some days, which is funny, too. Overall, she's a super friendly person and is super silly, which is awesome. Her accent is really funny too (it also comes out more when she's over-tired).

### Julian (@langley)

Julian is always a freakin' ray of sunshine and has crazy lore. To my knowledge (and like everyone else's), he's the first full-blooded CSHer, and his first time on floor was when he was eight years old. He also spent the summer before college on a commercial fishing boat in Alaska?! You should really ask *him* about these stories. We've also been in the same car on Rideboard three times as of Fall Camping 2025, which is kind of crazy.

### Nikolai (@gravy)

Nikolai let me borrow a blanket during Fall Camping. For that, I cannot thank him enough, even if it slid out from under me both nights.

### Riley (@monkey)

It's actually kind of crazy how much stuff me and Riley do together; Animania, intramural soccer, trips to Commons or Gracie's just before they close... Usually, if you're doing something, he's down to do it with you. He's also one of the more Quotefault-able fershmen, which has certainly led to some funny moments.

## Upperclassmen

If you're not on here, it might be because there's so goddamn many of you and I just haven't gotten to you yet! Don't be scared to reach out.

### Ada (@theai)

Ada has a specific brand of crude humor that makes her really fun to be around. I've spent plenty of time with her in the User Center or the Lounge doing the stupidest crap possible, like leaving heinous comments on AI slop YouTube videos or trying to learn Japanese by talking to Microsoft Copilot. Ada also hosts Animania, which introduced me to Evangelion, which I can't thank her for enough.

### Arnav (@zxcv)

Being on floor at the same time as Arnav is kind of like playing Five Nights at Freddy's, but he's also a really interesting person to talk to, even if he has a tendency to just appear wherever you're looking. He's super into embedded devices and low-level programming, both of which are really cool. He's also one of the few other people in CSH who prefer Mexican Coca-Cola to the same degree that I do, which I have to give him props for. Eventually he'll probably get me to watch Tron: Legacy. I don't know about the original from the 80s, though.

### Cooper (@lung)

Cooper is super friendly and is always a fun person to hang out with, even if he hates Evangelion (I don't understand, it's peak fiction!). He'll pretty much talk to you about anything, all you have to do is ask. He was one of my first Packet signatures and can always be found on floor after classes. Oh, he publishes my dumb articles in Segfault, too, even if he's late sometimes.

### Ella (@ella)

Ella is really friendly and is interested in a lot of super niche things that I appreciate, like Minecraft speedrunning and Devcade. She's about as involved with CSH as they come without being on E-board. She's got a great wealth of knowledge about college (haha that rhymes) and RIT, as well, since she's graduating in the spring. Our lunch schedules overlap on M/W/F, too.

### Mia (@mango)

You can't really write about Cooper without also writing about Mia; they're always together and match each other's energy perfectly. Mia is super kind and brings free snacks to floor a lot, which is an easy way to get on this list. He also says "bless you" any time I make a sound that even comes close to sounding like me or anyone else being sick, which is funny and touching at the same time.

### Shaela (@sparrow)

Shaela is another super friendly person who's always a joy to hang out with. The ride up to Brandreth for Fall Camping 2025 was probably a highlight of the trip because of the shit-talking we got up to. To be able to keep up with me when it comes to shit-talking is a skill. Oh, Shaela also makes sure that floor isn't always dirty and gross, so that's a plus, too!

## Alumni

If you're not on here, please, talk to me! There's a few people who I would like to put on here because I think they're cool, but haven't because I don't feel like I know them well enough (ahem, Mary, Matty B., and pretty much any alum I've eaten lunch with).

### Cecilia (@pixel)

The first actual conversation that I had with Cecilia was about pinball; I feel like that says enough. Cecilia's always really easy to talk to and is another one of those people who will talk to you about anything. She's also on floor a lot more than a lot of the other alumni, which is a big plus.
