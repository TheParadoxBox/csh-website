# Nick's website @ CSH

This is my next-gen website, hosted at <https://csh.rit.edu/~paradox>.

## How to build

Requires `pandoc`, `sed`, `yq`, and `coreutils`. Run `./build.sh` to build the website. Optionally, specify the `OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable to change where the built website will go (default is `./output`).
